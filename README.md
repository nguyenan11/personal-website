## Assignment components

#### Landing page

There is a landing page of `index.html` and 1 additional page of `contact.html`. 

#### Nav Bar

Everything is easy to navigate with navigation bar: it has 6 elements of *Home*, *About*, *Skills*, *Courses*, *Portfolio* and *Contact Me*.
* When site is on desktop or any large device, nav bar is at the header position.

* When window is resized to smaller screen, nav bar is at footer position, and it has a nice little feature of **JavaScript** for user to toggle the bar.

#### Internal Links

Click on any of the element in nav bar will direct the user to 1 of 6 specific HTML elements, which are equally styled and appealing. User can also go to `contact.html` by directing to *Contact Me* section and hit that button.
